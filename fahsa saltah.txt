Fahsa Saltah

Ingredients
1 tbsp. oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
Half onion, chopped
½ green chili pepper, chopped, more or less to taste
½ tsp cumin
½ tsp coriander
¼ tsp turmeric
3/4 tsp. salt
1 lb. beef cubes
5 cups water
A few tablespoons of prepared Hulba

instructions:

1)Place pressure cooker on medium heat and sauté garlic, onion, and chili pepper in oil until garlic browns and onion is translucent. Add cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt.

2)Clean beef thoroughly and add to onion mixture. Brown the meat for 5 minutes.

3)Add water to the mixture and seal the pressure cooker. Let cook for about 30 minutes on medium heat until meat is tender and breaks apart easily. (NOTE: If a pressure cooker is not available, cook meat in a regular pot for 1 ½ - 2 hours, or until meat is tender and breaks apart)

4)Remove from heat and remove top of the pressure cooker after cooling slightly. Break the meat apart with a fork as shown in video. The consistency of the broth should be similar to a slightly thick soup; if there is not sufficient broth, you may add extra water.

5)Pour the meat stew into a stone cookware and heat until bubbling. Add a few dollops of whipped hulba and serve piping hot with a side of fresh bread.
