INGREDIENTS

1.	4cups finely ground cornmeal (If you can find the kind that is so finely ground as to be like flour, grab it!!)
2.	8cups water

DIRECTIONS

1.	Heat water to boiling in a saucepan. Slowly pour the corn flour into boiling water. Avoid forming lumps.
2.	Stir continuously and mash any lumps that do form. Add more corn flour until it is thicker than mashed potatoes.
3.	Cook for three or four minutes, continue to stir. (Continuing to stir as the ugali thickens is the secret to success, i.e., lump-free ugali.)
4.	Top with a pat of butter or margarine, if desired.
5.	Cover and keep warm.
6.	Serve immediately with any meat or vegetable stew, or any dish with a sauce or gravy.
