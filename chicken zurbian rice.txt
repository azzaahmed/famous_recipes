Chicken Zurbian Rice:

Ingredients:

1 tbsp. oil
½ onion chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ green chili, optional
1 ½ tsp. salt
¾  tsp. turmeric
½ tsp. coriander
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground black pepper
½ tsp cinnamon
3-4 cardamom pods
3-4 whole cloves
5 cups water
1.5-2 lbs. chicken
2 cups basmati rice
Cashews, Almonds, and Golden raisins for serving

instructions:

1. Saute garlic, onion, and pepper in oil over medium heat until browned.

2. Add salt, turmeric, coriander, cumin, black pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves to onion mixture. Add chicken and cook until brown on the outside.

3. Add water and cook the chicken on medium heat for about 20-30 minutes if using a pressure cooker, or more if cooking in a regular pot. NOTE: Dark meat chicken will give the broth a better flavor, but the rice may be too greasy. I use a combination of dark and white meat chicken for the best flavor.

4. When the chicken is cooked through, assess how much water is left in the pot. You will want about 2 cups of water for every cup of rice, however this may vary greatly depending on the type of rice used as some are more absorbent. Add the rice to the broth, and the rice should be just covered by the water. If needed add more water a quarter cup at a time.

5. Cook the rice uncovered on medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the rice is about 2/3 cooked through and there is just a little bit of liquid left.

6. Now reduce the heat to low and cover the pot, do not seal the cooker. Let the rice steam for another 10 minutes until all liquid is absorbed. NOTE: Watch the rice during this stage and if the rice is burning at the bottom of the pot add water a tablespoon at a time. When all water is absorbed and rice is cooked through, turn off heat and let sit in the pot about 10 minutes before serving.

7. Garnish with a handful of raisins, almonds, and cashews.
