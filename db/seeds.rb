This is the tricky part of the dish, as lumps tend to form when the flour is added to the water. It will take a few tries before you make your first truly smooth dough. An alternative I use is to boil the water in an electric kettle or in a separate pan. Having sifted the flour into the cooking pan I gradually add one cup of water to the flour while vigorously stirring (reversing the process). I find that this prevents the formation of lumps. This process is even more difficult using white wheat flour, as it has I higher gluten content and tends to lump more easily.\r\n\r\n2)Add the remaining water, a little at a time, and use the wooden spoon to lift the dough allowing the water to flow beneath it and form a buffer from the heat.\r\n\r\n3)Cover with a lid and simmer uncovered for 15-20 minutes until the water is completely absorbed. It’s important not to skip this part as this cooks the flour and prevents bloating after eating this wholegrain flour.\r\nOnce the water has evaporated stir with the spoon over low heat until the paste comes together to form one lump.\r\n\r\n4)Grease a serving bowl with oil. Turn the dough into the bowl and quickly shape it, with greased hands, into a hemisphere, taking care is it will be hot.\r\nMake a small well in the top and pour on the topping of your choice (date syrup and olive oil or honey and butter).\r\nServe hot.\r\n\r\ncalories:243\r\n", visible: false},

NOTE: Dark meat chicken will give the broth a better flavor, but the rice may be too greasy. I use a combination of dark and white meat chicken for the best flavor.\r\n\r\n4. When the chicken is cooked through, assess how much water is left in the pot. You will want about 2 cups of water for every cup of rice, however this may vary greatly depending on the type of rice used as some are more absorbent. Add the rice to the broth, and the rice should be just covered by the water. If needed add more water a quarter cup at a time.\r\n\r\n5. Cook the rice uncovered on medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the rice is about 2/3 cooked through and there is just a little bit of liquid left.\r\n\r\n6. Now reduce the heat to low and cover the pot, do not seal the cooker. Let the rice steam for another 10 minutes until all liquid is absorbed. NOTE: Watch the rice during this stage and if the rice is burning at the bottom of the pot add water a tablespoon at a time. When all water is absorbed and rice is cooked through, turn off heat and let sit in the pot about 10 minutes before serving.\r\n\r\n7.
